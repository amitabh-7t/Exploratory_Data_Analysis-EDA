# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍📊

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) repository! This repository serves as a complete guide to understanding and implementing EDA techniques with Python, focusing on uncovering insights and preparing data for deeper analysis.

---

## 📑 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis is a crucial first step in any data science project. This repository provides practical code examples and explanations for:
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and detecting outliers 🧹
- **Data Visualization**: Creating plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn to interpret distributions and trends 📈
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyzing central tendencies, dispersion, and relationships between features 📊
- **Correlation & Relationships**: Uncovering connections between features through correlation analysis and visual tools 🔗
- **Case Studies**: Applying EDA techniques on real datasets to gain actionable insights 📁
